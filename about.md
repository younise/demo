This is 1030am. A collection of hypertext dispatches on technology, personal interests, and the noteworthy.

He contributes to the engineering of VMware Cloud Foundation, VMware Validated Solutions, the former the VMware Validated Designs, and other engineering initatives. His primary focus is on private and public cloud platforms, cloud automation, and identity and access management. As an accomplished solutions architect his focus is enabling customers and the community to accelerate and simplify their private cloud and multi-cloud infrastructure and automation services.
